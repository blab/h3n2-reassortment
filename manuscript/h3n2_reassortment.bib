OBJECTIVES: The methods to measure these genetic shifts have not yet provided a quantitative answer to questions such as: what is the rate of genetic reassortment during a local epidemic? Are all possible reassortments equally likely or are there preferred patterns?
METHODS: To answer these questions and provide a quantitative way to measure genetic shifts, a new method for detecting reassortments from nucleotide sequence data was created that does not rely upon phylogenetic analysis. Two different sequence databases were used: human H3N2 viruses isolated in New York State between 1995 and 2006, and human H3N2 viruses isolated in New Zealand between 2000 and 2005.
RESULTS: Using this new method, we were able to reproduce all the reassortments found in earlier works, as well as detect, with very high confidence, many reassortments that were not detected by previous authors. We obtain a lower bound on the reassortment rate of 2-3 events per year, and find a clear preference for reassortments involving only one segment, most often hemagglutinin or neuraminidase. At a lower frequency several segments appear to reassort in vivo in defined groups as has been suggested previously in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly suggest that the patterns of reassortment in the viral population are not random. Deciphering these patterns can be a useful tool in attempting to understand and predict possible influenza pandemics.},

2. The agglutination titer of infected allantoic fluid procured in a standard way is relatively constant, regardless of the influenza strain used and its pathogenicity for mice.
3. Virus preparations inactivated by heat or storage may retain their agglutinating power.
4. Certain animal sera contain a partially heat-labile factor which, in low dilution, inhibits the agglutination of chicken red cells by influenza A and influenza B viruses.
5. The agglutination inhibition test, using ferret and human sera, gives qualitative data regarding influenza antibodies which are similar to the information obtained on the same sera by means of the virus neutralization test.
6. There is a definite relationship between the agglutination inhibition titer and the virus neutralization titer of a serum. On a logarithmic scale of both variables, this relationship is essentially linear within the range investigated.
7. The agglutination inhibition titer of immune ferret serum is inversely proportional to the amount of virus used in the test.},

Hills and valleys of influenza infection
Each one of us may encounter several different strains of the ever-changing influenza virus during a lifetime. Scientists can now summarize such histories of infection over a lifetime of exposure. Fonville et al. visualize the interplay between protective responses and the evasive influenza virus by a technique called antibody landscape modeling (see the Perspective by Lessler). Landscapes reveal how exposure to new strains of the virus boost immune responses and indicate possibilities for optimizing future vaccination programs.

    doi = {10.1128/JVI.01861-14},
Importance Human influenza A viruses continuously change antigenically to circumvent the immune protection evoked by vaccination or previously circulating viral strains. To maintain vaccine protection and thereby reduce the mortality and morbidity caused by infections, regular updates of the vaccine strains are required. We have developed a data-driven framework for vaccine strain prediction which facilitates the computational analysis of genetic and antigenic data and does not rely on explicit evolutionary models. Our computational decision procedure generated good matches of the vaccine strain to the circulating predominant strain for most seasons and could be used to support the expert-guided prediction made by the WHO and may allow to further increase vaccine efficiency.},
